      <h2> Choice B, 2</h2>
      <p>In the progressive 1945 essay, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">“As We May Think”</a>, Vannevar Bush addresses the problem we face in archiving the great mass of human record. The engineer introduces the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c539cK58ees">“memex”</a>, a machine he claims supplements our limited memory and consequently allows us the privilege to forget.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> Bush proposes a natural solution to the way in which information has been archived, but is in fact artificial in how it deals with our storage of knowledge.</br></p>
      <p>Vannevar Bush’s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">piece</a> was published immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the tail end of World War II. It is essentially his plea to the public to care about science, which, after the immense repercussions of the war, proved to be increasingly difficult. The end of the twentieth century marked a boom in scientific achievements as well as the beginning of modern computing, when digital computers were built with the purpose of breaking cryptological codes. He claims scientific efforts hadn’t solely been aimed towards destruction and warfare, but also towards understanding and improving human lives, stating they have “released us partly from the bondage of bare existence”.<a href="#1"><sup>2</sup></a> By guiding the reader through these human accomplishments, Vannevar Bush points towards an emerging concern for archiving human knowledge. </br></p>
      <p>Throughout <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">“As We May Think”</a> Bush points out the problem we face in confronting the great mass of the human record and criticizes the way information had been organized until that point in history. Faced with the repercussions of the war, he claims there should be a way in which to “better review [our] shady past and analyze more completely and objectively [our] present problems”. <a href="#1"><sup>3</sup></a> In addition, as he was familiar with the emerging computing systems of the 1940’s, he points out “the artificiality” in systems of indexing and claims the form of file organization isn’t able to accurately mimic our associative thought process. Bush then proposes that if we tailor our information systems after our own thought processes, we’ll have access to the entirety of human knowledge. This is the first time we see an urge to archive and access information rather than to generate knowledge. <a href="#1"><sup>4</sup></a></br></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">“As We May Think”</a>culminates in Vannevar Bush’s proposition of an analog machine called the “memex”, which mimics humans’ thought process of associative selection and consequently allows us the privilege of forgetting information. Firstly, the memex stores all of an individual’s books, records and communications, all of which can be consulted and annotated with ease. What is most innovative about the machine, however, is how it presents the ability to record and share our own thought processes, or trails, as we navigate through of items of text stored within it. Throughout the essay, Bush’s language reflects how he thinks of this machine as an extension and a supplement to the human mind. He claims individuals shouldn’t “overtax [their] limited memory” with information and should instead have the “assurance [they] can find it again”. <a href="#1"><sup>5</sup></a> In fact, Bush compares the way in which information is transmitted to the brain to the electrical vibrations transmitted by television sets.</br></p>
      <p>Nevertheless, even though Bush sought to create a natural form of indexing, this model was itself artificial. By equating our thought process to the electrical circuits in machines, he asserts the memex, or the extension to our mind, is not that human after all. T.H. Nelson points this out when he proposes an alternate to the memex, the <a href="http://signallake.com/innovation/FileStructure65.pdf">“evolutionary file structure”</a>, that is instead chimerical and changes with time. <a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> This means the individual has the freedom to delete and upend categories or fields used for information retrieval, making for a decaying file structure . Nelson calls attention the fact that the perfect archive of human consciousness referred to by Bush is impossible since the creation of files are premised on a fundamental absence. He calls into question the circulation of knowledge, which had until that point been fundamentally intertwined with forgetting. Vannevar Bush built the memex based on the assumption that if science hasn’t progressed, it is because we’re ignorant. However, it is human nature’s process of forgetfulness and repetition of ideas and that marks the spread of knowledge.</br></p>
       <p>In <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">“As We May Think”</a>, the changing attitudes towards our approach to knowledge, which is seen as limitless but relatively inaccessible, is reflected by the invention of the memex. Although Vannevar Bush set the precedent for modern associative file structures, he failed to perceive how forgetting information can in fact stimulate the dissemination of knowledge since it is fundamental to human nature.</p>
