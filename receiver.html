      <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; ">While interning at Paperless Post this summer I worked closely with another designer, a product manager and a group of developers on finding new ways to convert card receivers into card senders. Throughout my internship I was involved in a variety of projects, including the “receiver experience” one below.</p>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>Improve the reply rate by providing a seamless experience for guests replying to event invitations.</p>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>Before jumping into the project, I spent some time familiarizing myself with the different invitation and card types Paperless Post’s offers, since each requires different pieces of information from their guests. For example, an RSVP invitation may require the guest to answer if he/she is attending with a +1 while a Save the Date may require the guest to provide a mailing address. I quickly became aware of the importance of designing a system that would be versatile enough to provide a seamless experience across all event types (including their edge cases) and platforms (mobile and desktop breakpoints). For this project, I was assigned to sketch out the reply flow for RSVP invitations since they required the most information from guests. Starting off with the most complex flow would make designing the reply flows for the other event types easier.</p>
      <p>After much debate on whether the reply flow should be contained in a modal or integrated into the event page in an inline design, the latter was chosen for three main reasons:</p>
      <p>(1) Allowed the users to see other elements of the page while answering questions</br>
      (2) Doesn’t provide a gating experience</br>
      (3) When user returns to the page without having completed all the steps, user can immediately sees the next question that should be completed</br>
      All these reasons drive user engagement, which ultimately result in a better reply rate.</br></p>
      <p>Finally designing! I started off designing an animated answer form which expands as users answer questions, with the previous answers shown in a “summary form”. À la Oscar Health.</p>
      <p>After designing a couple of states on desktop, we realized that the inline reply flow had to ultimately be a good experience on mobile, so we shifted to a mobile-first approach. After all, more that 50% of users were accessing the event invitation page on their phones. In the end, the constraints that the phone provided made designing the reply flow system easier, and we ended up with a seamless experience which worked well across event types and platforms.</p>
